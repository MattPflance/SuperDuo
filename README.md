Given 2 functional apps, make them production-ready. This involves finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

Alexandria: A book list and barcode scanner app.
Football Scores : An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).

This repo contains 2 Android apps for Udacity's Nanodegree program. Clone or download this repository and treat both apps as their own Android app.

NOTE: Football Scores requires and API key from api.football-data.org. Please get your free API key and place it in the strings.xml file.
