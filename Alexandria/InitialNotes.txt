Major:
- Settings screen as no ActionBar/Toolbar. No backwards navigation.
- Settings screen does not display currently selected start screen.
- Keyboard is always visible and doesnâ€™t disappear when going back.
- No way to submit an ISBN-13 number?
- Scanning does not work, just pops open a Toast.
- Rotating to landscape changes action bar text to Alexandria when it should be one of the menu options.
- Scan/Add screen landscape layout is pretty bad and needs fixing.
- Cool icon.

Performance:
- Overdraw on pop-out menu is in the red.
- Opening and closing the menu (tapping on the back button) causes memory to be allocated??
- ****Stack of activities really uses up memory****
	- There should be no stack because of the menu options. Each time a new activity is selected, all others should be destroyed.
- Seeing garbage collection is cool.

Minor:
- No padding around About This App. Change text too perhaps.
